# Hemodynamics Platform

The cornerstone of the main author's doctoral work was the introduction of 'mechanomics' into coronary CFD analysis. By integrating this novel concept and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-derived radiomic and morphological information, this Python-Qt based interface was developed to automate high-throughput feature extraction. This innovation drastically reduced analysis time from two months to a mere four hours per case.

## Getting Started
Jay First Correct 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For Python + Conda + Windows environment set up:

Win + R type 'cmd' open terminal
```bash
activate
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

Say what the step will be:

\```bash
Give the example
\```

And repeat:

\```bash
until finished
\```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end-to-end tests

Explain what these tests test and why:

\```bash
Give an example
\```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why:

\```bash
Give an example
\```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
